# Network Performance Analysis using Mininet and Iperf
The analysis is performed using 3 distinct metrics under a simplified case of
**linear** network topology which has 1 switch and 2 hosts, as shown below:
![topo](/SingleSwitchTopo.png)
The numbers assigned to the switch and 2 hosts correspond to the default names
given by mininet, which are actually named "h1", "s1", and "h2". The bandwidth
for both links are set to the maximum possible 1Gbps for mininet version 2.2.1.
(Please refer to [SingleSwitchTopo.py][SST] for furthur implementation details)
After the setup 3 separate tests are performed as demonstrated below.

## File Size
## Latency
## Loss Rate
